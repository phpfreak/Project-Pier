What's New
~~~~~~~~~~~~
2.0b1 It's been made fully compatible with ProjectPier 0.8.8 (tested on SP2). Lots of small interface tweaks have been made; the tabs have been modernized, the page drop-down menus have been made more obvious, and check out the much-improved Edit Permissions page!

1.0 It's been completely overhauled since the alpha releases.


~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
IMPORTANT
~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to use this theme with project pier you will need to change the core files of your project pier installation, at least if using Project Pier v. 0.8.2 and below.
Instructions are included here, but be aware that it may cause compatibility issues in the future.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Theme Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
1. Download theme files from the ProjectPier website - http://www.projectpier.org/.
2. Unpack the files to a temporary space on your hard drive
3. Upload the files to your web server in the directory
   /projectroot/public/assets/themes/ where projectroot is the root
   directory of your ProjectPier or activeCollab installation.
4. Log into your ProjectPier or activeCollab installation and select:
   Administration > Configuration > General
   Select your new theme from the drop-down menu and click the "Save" button
5. Replace /projectroot/public/assets/themes/magellan/images/layout/company_logo.gif
   with your own organization's logo, with a transparent or white background and a height
   of 150px.

Thanks, and enjoy!
