Upgrading to ProjectPier 0.8.8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ProjectPier 0.8.8 is NOT database compatible with previous versions.

Upgrade instructions 

1) Install 0.8.8 in another directory than 0.8.6
2) Make a copy of your 0.8.6 database
3) Append 086 to the 0.8.6 root directories mentioned in appendix A
4) Copy the 0.8.8 root directories mentioned in appendix A to your 0.8.6 root
5) Run the upgrade script from the browser <086 root>/public/patch/patch.php?id=086-088
6) Monitor the output of the upgrade script

In case the scripts stops with a FAIL message:
 a) remove all the lines including the line that gave a FAIL message from /public/patch/086-088.sql
 b) rerun the script from the browser

In case the browser shows a white page:
 a) remove all the lines including the line that gave a white page
 b) rerun the script from the browser

Note: Some commands may take longer to complete than the browser is willing to wait (time out).
The command is still executed but we need to rerun the script without the command.

7) Copy /public086/files to /public/files (overwrite all)
8) Login. All should work fine now. Force a browser reload to reload all stylesheets.

Fallback instructions

1) Delete the 0.8.6 directories mentioned in appendix A
2) Remove 086 from the directories in your 0.8.6 root
3) Restore your database
