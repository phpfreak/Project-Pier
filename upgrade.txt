Upgrading to ProjectPier 0.8.8
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ProjectPier 0.8.8 is NOT database compatible with previous versions.

Upgrade instructions 

 1) Enable all plugins (you will want to note down which plugins you were not using to disable them later).
 2) Unzip the ProjectPier v0.8.8 package to your hard drive. Be sure you are able to locate the pp088 folder you just unzipped.
 3) Make a backup of your 0.8.6 database before you begin making any changes.
 4) Append 086 to the 0.8.6 core folders mentioned in appendix A. This will make sure we can restore if necessary.
 5) Copy the files in the 0.8.6 root to a new folder named root086.
 6) Upload the 0.8.8 core folders mentioned in appendix A to your 0.8.6 root on your web server.
 7) Upload the files in the 0.8.8 root to the 0.8.6 root on your web server.
 8) Run the upgrade script from the browser http://YOUR-PP-WEBSITE.COM/public/patch/patch.php?id=086-088. Replace "YOUR-PP-WEBSITE.COM" with your own domain name. 
 9) Monitor the output of the upgrade script

 In case the upgrade script stops with a FAIL message:
 a) from the top remove all the lines including the line that gave a FAIL message from /public/patch/086-088.sql
 b) rerun the script from the browser

 In case the browser shows a white page:
 a) from the top remove all the lines including the line that gave a white page
 b) rerun the script from the browser

 Note: Some commands may take longer to complete than the browser is willing to wait (time out).
 The command is still executed but we need to rerun the script without the commands that executed already.

10) Create a new directory named tmp in the 0.8.6 root (this will hold all the uploaded files and sessions)
11) Copy /public086/files to /public/files (overwrite all)
12) Login. All should work fine now. Force a browser reload to reload all stylesheets.
13) Disable all plugins you are not using.
14) Periodically clean tmp from all files older than 1 day 

Fallback instructions

 1) Delete the directories mentioned in appendix A
 2) Remove 086 from the name of the directories mentioned in appendix A
 3) Copy the files from root086 to the root of 0.8.6
 4) Restore your database
